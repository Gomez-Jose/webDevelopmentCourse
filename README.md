## About the Project

I chose to create a page for a friend who owns a store centered around toys,mangas and collectables. The page has several sections you can interact with the help of the navbar.

Before starting to code we had to make a wireframe which showed the way we imagined how the website should look like. I made mine with the responsive view as well.

NOTE: Wireframe is located in this repository.

I built the website using HTML & CSS and then added Bootstrap where I thought it would improve the project.

Some basic principles of SEO were covered in the course and included in the project. Regarding SCSS, I tried to recycle code as much as I could and made all the partials that I thought were necessary for a small project such as these one.

Feedback is always appreciated!
