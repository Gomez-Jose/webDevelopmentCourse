# Personal Portfolio

This is my very first development project ever. Made for [**Coderhouse's Web Development Course**](https://www.coderhouse.com/online/desarrollo-web-online) in 2021.

## About the Project

I chose to create a page for a friend who owns a store centered around toys,mangas and collectables. The page has several sections you can interact with the help of the navbar.

Before starting to code we had to make a wireframe which showed the way we imagined how the website should look like. I made mine with the responsive view as well.

NOTE: Wireframe is located in this repository.

I built the website using HTML & CSS and then added Bootstrap where I thought it would improve the project. 

Feedback is always appreciated!
